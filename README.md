tbs-episode-chooser-
====================

Have a huge library of TV shows, but don't want to choose which episode to watch? The tyranny of choice of 200 episodes of Seinfeld getting you down? Just run this python script on the folder where your episode is stored, and voil√°, an episode is playing in VLC! Never think about whether 'The Little Kicks' or 'The Soup Nazi' is what you want to watch at that moment. It's like turning on TBS except you never have to watch Burn Notice.
